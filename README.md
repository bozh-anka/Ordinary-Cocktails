# Ordinary Cocktails Web App

My high school art teacher once told me that a piece of art is only finished once you stop working and choose to learn from what you have achieved.
Otherwise, you can endlessly polish a piece without progressing past it. So I chose to stop here with this application, it has the desired functionality and a pleasing appearance.
It is not, as I first intended, developed with React, it is vanilla JavaScript written in WebStorm. I chose that IDE due to how convenient it is for pushing to Git Hub.
Normally I'd use Brackets, a text editor with live preview, but that'd mean pushing to git through the command prompt, which I found inconvenient.

As for React, I read the documentation and decreed that learning its syntax on a timer would be too overwhelming.
The project already included plenty of new things for me to learn, such as talking to an API.

The starting page is the file CocktailList.html, its script is CocktailScript.js and the stylesheet is CocktailStyle.css
The second page, to which users get by selecting a cocktail from the list, is CocktailDetails.html its script is CocktailDetailScript.js and its stylesheet is DetailsStyle.css.
